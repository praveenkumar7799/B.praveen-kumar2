Number guessing game in Java
The task is to write a Java program in which a user will get K trials to guess a randomly generated number. Below are the rules of the game:

If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is higher than the actual number.
If the guessed number is smaller than the actual number, the program will respond with the message that the guessed number is lower than the actual number.
If the guessed number is equal to the actual number or if the K trials are exhausted, the program will end with a suitable message.
Approach: Below are the steps:  

The approach is to generate a random number using Math.random() method in Java.
Now using a loop, take K input from the user and for each input print whether the number is smaller or larger than the actual number.
If within K trials the user guessed the number correctly, print that the user won.
Else print that he was not able to guess and then print the actual number.
Below is the implementation of the above approach: 

// Java program for the above approach

import java.util.Scanner;
 

public class GFG {
 

    // Function that implements the

    // number guessing game

    public static void

    guessingNumberGame()

    {

        // Scanner Class

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
 

        // Generate the numbers

        int number = 1 + (int)(100

                               * Math.random());
 

        // Given K trials

        int K = 5;
 

        int i, guess;
 

        System.out.println(

            "A number is chosen"

            + " between 1 to 100."

            + "Guess the number"

            + " within 5 trials.");
 

        // Iterate over K Trials

        for (i = 0; i < K; i++) {
 

            System.out.println(

                "Guess the number:");
 

            // Take input for guessing

            guess = sc.nextInt();
 

            // If the number is guessed

            if (number == guess) {

                System.out.println(

                    "Congratulations!"

                    + " You guessed the number.");

                break;

            }

            else if (number > guess

                     && i != K - 1) {

                System.out.println(

                    "The number is "

                    + "greater than " + guess);

            }

            else if (number < guess

                     && i != K - 1) {

                System.out.println(

                    "The number is"

                    + " less than " + guess);

            }

        }
 

        if (i == K) {

            System.out.println(

                "You have exhausted"

                + " K trials.");
 

            System.out.println(

                "The number was " + number);

        }

    }
 

    // Driver Code

    public static void

    main(String arg[])

    {
 

        // Function Call

        guessingNumberGame();

    }
}
